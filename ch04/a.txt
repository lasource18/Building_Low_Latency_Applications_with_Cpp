Here's the content of macros.h below:
```
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

#define LIKELY(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1)
#define UNLIKELY(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)

inline auto ASSERT(bool cond, const std::string& msg) noexcept
{
    if (UNLIKELY(!cond))
    {
        std::cerr << msg << std::endl;
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    
}
```

I also need you to give me a line by line explanation of this code also 

Now help me to craft a post on LinkedIn announcing my intention of starting to build a low-latency trading trading and giving a short walk-through of this code to attract the interest of prospective employers
